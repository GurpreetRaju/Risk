Some important ones:
<ul>
  <li>The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains (of which there is exactly one), plus the .java extension.</li>
  <li> A source file consists of, in order:
    <ol>
      <li>License or copyright information, if present</li>
      <li>Package statement</li>
      <li>Import statements</li>
      <li>Exactly one top-level class</li>
      <li>Exactly one blank line separates each section that is present.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Wildcard imports, static or otherwise, are not used.</li>
  <li>Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.</li>
  <li>Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style ("Egyptian brackets") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:
      <ol>
        <li>No line break before the opening brace.</li>
        <li>Line break after the opening brace.</li>
        <li>Line break before the closing brace.</li>
        <li>Line break after the closing brace, only if that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or named class. For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by else or a comma.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two spaces.</li>
</ul>
